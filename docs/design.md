Usability Heuristics
========

Objective: Choose two usability heuristics or inclusive design principle to change for your site.

Heuristic Two - Match between system and real world
-------

To better match what Ravelry does and the organic nature of how I personally select projects, I'd like to add a "tags" column to my project table.  This will allow me to create and update projects with searchable tags, such as the name of who it is for, if it uses a certain technique, or if it the patttern is designed by previously liked pattern writer.  I often add things to my Ravely "queue" based on designers such as Jared Flood and Brenda Dayne, or for the person I think would like that item.  Being able to add this to my project will align it a bit more to how I plan my projects.

Heuristic Seven - Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
-------

If possible, I'd like to add a dark mode to my project.  As the main user, I prefer dark mode screens because they are less likely to trigger migraines or eye strain.  A quick look at Ravelry's website shows that they do have a dark mode, so it may be possible to use their API to apply to my own site.
